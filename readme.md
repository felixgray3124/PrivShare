  # PrivShare – Decentralized Privacy File Sharing

PrivShare is a **Web3-native file sharing platform** built on **Filecoin Onchain Cloud**.  
It empowers users to upload files, generate **secure sharing links**, and distribute them with **privacy, verifiability, and ownership** guaranteed by Filecoin.  

PrivShare aims to become the decentralized alternative to Dropbox or WeTransfer — but with **end-to-end encryption, on-chain verification, and flexible monetization**.

## 🆕 Updates in This Wave

### ✅ Wave 2 Implementation Complete
- **Real Filecoin Integration**: Implemented actual Filecoin storage using Synapse SDK
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Added AES-256 encryption with custom key management
- **IPFS + Pinata Mapping**: Implemented share code to CID mapping using IPFS and Pinata
- **Enhanced UI/UX**: Complete frontend with drag-and-drop upload, file preview, and progress tracking
- **Wallet Integration**: Full Web3 wallet support with RainbowKit and wagmi
- **Share Code System**: Flexible `privshare://` format with IPFS-based metadata storage
- **File Preview**: Users can preview file information before downloading
- **Key Management**: Custom encryption key generation and secure key sharing

## 🚩 Problem

### Centralized risks
Most file-sharing services (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive) are **centralized**:
- Files can be deleted due to censorship, copyright issues, or policy changes.  
- Accounts can be banned without recourse.  
- Users never truly own their files.

### Privacy issues
- Providers have **access to user data**, lacking true end-to-end encryption.  
- Sensitive files are vulnerable to leaks, government requests, or insider misuse.  

### Lack of verifiability
- Users cannot prove whether a file is still stored or retrievable.  
- No cryptographic proof of file persistence exists in traditional systems.  

### No native monetization
- Creators cannot set paywalls or subscriptions.  
- File sharing is either free, or locked behind platforms that take large fees.

👉 These problems create a gap: **people need file sharing that is private, censorship-resistant, verifiable, and flexible.**

---

## ✅ Solution

PrivShare offers **a decentralized, privacy-first file sharing experience**:

- **Upload once → Get a sharing link**  
  Files uploaded through PrivShare generate a unique link. Share it directly with others, no centralized servers needed.

- **End-to-end encryption**  
  Only recipients with the decryption key can access. Even PrivShare cannot read user data.

- **Proof of Data Possession (PDP)**  
  Files remain **provably stored** on Filecoin, cryptographically verifiable by both uploader and recipient.

- **Access control & monetization**  
  - Free & public sharing  
  - Private sharing with decryption keys  
  - Paid access with FilecoinPay: one-time, streaming, or subscriptions

- **Fast retrieval with FilCDN**  
  File downloads are as smooth as centralized services, without compromising decentralization.

👉 **PrivShare = privacy + ownership + verifiability + monetization.**

## 🏗 Technical Design

### Architecture Overview
1. User uploads file → Filecoin WarmStorage  
2. System generates a secure sharing link  
3. PDP contracts periodically verify file persistence  
4. Recipient accesses link → FilecoinPay validates access (if required)  
5. FilCDN accelerates delivery  
6. Recipient decrypts locally (if encrypted)

### Core Components
- **Filecoin WarmStorage** → Decentralized storage layer  
- **PDP contracts** → Verifiable storage proofs  
- **FilecoinPay** → Payments and access control  
- **FilCDN** → High-speed retrieval  
- **Frontend dApp** → Upload, manage, and share files via wallet login

## 📊 Market Opportunity

The **cloud storage and file-sharing market** is massive:
- Dropbox, Google Drive, and others dominate a **$100B+ market**.  
- Yet, they are **centralized, censorable, and lack monetization**.  

### Growing user demand:
- **Individuals** want privacy-respecting file sharing.  
- **Content creators** want to monetize content directly.  
- **NGOs & activists** need censorship-proof publishing.  
- **Businesses** want global file distribution without compliance risks.
